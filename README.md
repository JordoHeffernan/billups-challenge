This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run this project locally:
- Clone Repo
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`

Resources: 
- https://reactjs.org
- https://developer.mozilla.org
- https://redux.js.org/
- https://nodejs.org/en/
- And I referenced some older projects of my own for folder structure and style elements as well as a handful of stackoverflow forums.
